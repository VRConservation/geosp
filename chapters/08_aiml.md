# AI
Can artificial intelligence revolutionize the geospatial world? 

## Future edition
The short answer is not yet. Machine learning (ML) is well developed in the free and open source (cf. chapters or tutorials from Leafmap and the R geocomputation book). ML is often conflated with AI, but it's not the same. Artificial intelligence for geospatial is at the gee-whiz stage, but it's not amazing. One recent example showed prompt engineering with GeoGPT to produce some ok chloropleth maps that would like to take the same amount of time to put together using the appropriate dataset and software highlighted in this book. Plus, taking a little time to run the code and do exploratory data analysis always allows you to know the data, which is something that doesn't happen when you ask a question and get a map. Also, GeoGPT is not free or open source!

An exception to the usefulness side I've seen with AI is [Bunting Lab's](https://buntinglabs.com/) autocomplete for map digitization, which installs as a QGIS plugin. This isn't a free tool, but it seems like it would certainly be worth its weight in gold if you needed to do a lot of map digitizing, taking much of the tedious manual labor out of this task.

Due to AI's underwhelming but promising status to date, I'm going to wait another year to see if more compelling examples arise. I've provided a few promising links. Overall, AI could help democratize geospatial analysis by lowering the cost of entry to both data and coding.

## Resources
- [Autonomous GIS](https://github.com/gladcolor/LLM-Geo). This repo and LLM are pretty cool and hopefully will receive further development over time. Unfortunately, there was a lot of activity from commits when it came out, but not much since.
- [Jupyter generative AI](https://blog.jupyter.org/generative-ai-in-jupyter-3f7174824862). Generative AI coding in Jupyter notebooks.
- [human brain edge over ai article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-human-brain-still-has-edge-over-ai-fast-company-j2jpe/)
- [A Beginner's Guide to Prompt Engineering with GitHub Copilot](http://gg.gg/1b54nw). This is an extensive guide on how to engineer your prompts to code better and best use AI. It is also applicable to prompts in other platforms such as Gemini or ChatGPT.
Articles on copilot prompt engineering.
- [MLOps Resources](http://gg.gg/1bb1bk). A curated list of resources, tools, frameworks, articles, and projects related to Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
- [GeoGPT](http://gg.gg/1bb1b4). An introduction to the GeoGPT model through ChatGPT article at medium.com. The results are somewhat underwhelming but going to the Github repo will give you more compelling examples.
- [Aino AI plugin](http://gg.gg/1bb1cc). An accessible AI plugin for QGIS for all users.
- [Clay Foundation Model](https://clay-foundation.github.io/model/index.html). Does it only work on Linux devices with CUDA GPUs? What the?
