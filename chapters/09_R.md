# R

## Similarities
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

```{figure} /figures/rgee.png
:name: comparison

Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee](http://gg.gg/19zkau). Note that Python requires the command lines 'import ee' and 'ee.Initialize()' and R requires 'library(rgee)' and 'ee_Initialize() to run Earth Engine. Javascript does not.
```

In fact, it's similar enough to make each challenging to keep straight, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.

Reminder that geemap has a javascript to python converter built into package.

```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of < + -, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option + - in Windows/Mac.
```
