# R
R is the definitive programming language for data analysis and visualization in academia. But it's increasingly being used more broadly due to its ease of use and many analysis packages.

**The remainder of chapter is coming soon!**

## Similarities
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

```{figure} /figures/rgee.png
:name: comparison

Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee](http://gg.gg/19zkau). Note that Python require additional commands to run Earth Engine.
```

In fact, it's similar enough to make each coding language organized in your head, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.


```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of <-, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option and - (Alt and minus sign) in Windows/Mac.
```

## Installation
The [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) desktop IDE is very good and only requires a two stop installation of R and RStudio. The IDE has a terminal, code section, installs packages through search, a variable/file panel, and a preview window that will show maps, graphs, or other outputs.

If you don't want to install yet another IDE, you can run R through VS Code with a number of basic to bespoke options:

1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/). 
2. Install the language server in R: 'install.packages("languageserver")'
3. Go to extensions and install the R Extension Pack by Yuki Ueda. This will install R (the coding language) and R-LSP (provides language support and autocomplete for commands).
4. Install extra packages such as [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) to make R easier to use. See the notes in the R extension in VS Code for additional recommendations, links, and installation instructions. [This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-fresh-start-for-r-in-vscode-ec61ed108cf6) article is a concise guide for setup. 

## EDA
The R library DataExplorer allows you to quickly perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets. I've adapted this section from a post in datascienceplus.com from [Raja 2018](https://datascienceplus.com/blazing-fast-eda-in-r-with-dataexplorer/).

```{tip} **Package Installation**. If you're using RSTudio you can also install packages by going to the packages tab in the Files, Plots, Packages pane (default location lower right), select Packages, Install then enter the package name in the open window.

**Running R Script**. You can run each line of code entered by placing the cursor at the comment or line of code you want to run then clicking the Run button in the upper right of the code pane (default location upper left) or using control/command enter on your keyboard. You can also highlight an entire block or section of code and run it with the same command.
```

Install the Data Explorer package and load it

```
install.packages('DataExplorer')
library(DataExplorer)
```

Read the dataset, inspect the head and total number of rows.

```
#read csv
lewo <- read.csv('./test/cacao.csv', header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

#examine head and count total dataset rows
head(lewo)
nrow(lewo)
```
Instead of head() and nrow() you can call summary statistics on the dataset with the command `summary()`.

Plotting a histogram is great way to start analyzing continuous variables

The `create_report()` function will run all of the EDA commands above, convert the outputs to an html file then open the report in your default browser. This is useful if you want to enter one line and get a rapid summary of everything for the dataset.

## LidR
Example coming soon!

## DuckDB
Yes you can execute DuckDB in R! It's everywhere and it's somewhat to code in R than Python

Install DuckDB, import the library, and create an in-memory database

```
# install and import duckdb
install.packages('duckdb')
library('duckdb')
con <- dbConnect(duckdb())
```

Create a simple table and insert two items into the table

```
# create a table
dbExecute(con, "CREATE TABLE items(item VARCHAR, value DECIMAL(10, 2), count INTEGER)")
# insert two items into the table
dbExecute(con, "INSERT INTO items VALUES ('jeans', 20.0, 1), ('hammer', 42.2, 2)")
```

Write a query for the table and show it in the R console

```
# Query and print to console
res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM items")
print(res)
```

## Resources

- **[Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/)**. An excellent free and open source book hosted on Github and covers many aspects of geospatial analysis in R {cite}`lovelace`. **[Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/)** is another excellent resource {cite}`sds`. Both publications are great if you are new to R. Spatial Data Science is particularly good for explanations and figures accompanied by R codeblocks to show you how to put together the code.
