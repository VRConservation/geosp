# R
R is the definitive programming language for data analysis and visualization in academia. But it's increasingly being used more broadly due to its ease of use and many analysis packages.

Remainder of chapter coming soon!

## Similarities
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

:name: comparison

Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee](http://gg.gg/19zkau). Note that Python require additional commands to run Earth Engine.
```

In fact, it's similar enough to make each challenging to keep straight, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.


```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of <-, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option and - (Alt and minus sign) in Windows/Mac.
```
## LidR
Example coming soon!
