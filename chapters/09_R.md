# R
R is the definitive programming language for data analysis and visualization in academia. But it's increasingly being used more broadly due to its ease of use and many analysis packages.

**The remainder of chapter is coming soon!**

## Similarities
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

:name: comparison

Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee](http://gg.gg/19zkau). Note that Python require additional commands to run Earth Engine.
```

In fact, it's similar enough to make each coding language organized in your head, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.


```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of <-, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option and - (Alt and minus sign) in Windows/Mac.
```
## R mapping
Coming soon!

## LidR
Example coming soon!

## Resources

- **[Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/)**. An excellent free and open source book hosted on Github and covers many aspects of geospatial analysis in R {cite}`lovelace`. **[Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/)** is another excellent resource {cite}`sds`. Both publications are great if you are new to R. Spatial Data Science is particularly good for explanations and figures accompanied by R codeblocks to show you how to put together the code.
- **[Neon intro to R](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/packages-r)**. National Ecological Observatory Network from the US National Science Foundation introductory R tutorial.
- https://jean-romain.github.io/lidRbook/index.html. Notebook for the LidR module.
- **[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/01-rstudio-intro/index.html)**. Data carprentry R module. Data carpentry also has an intro to geospatial [module](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-curriculum).
- **[Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)**. Look! You can do statistical learning in R or Python - Bonus!
- **[r-spatial/rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee)**. An R library for Google Earth Engine. Chapter 6.4 of the Earth Engine Fundamentals and Applications is focused on rgee {cite}`eefa`.
- **[lidR](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/)**. Online book for the lidR package.
