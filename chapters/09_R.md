# R
R is the definitive programming language for data analysis and visualization in academia. But it's increasingly being used more broadly due to its ease of use and many analysis packages.

**The remainder of chapter is coming soon!**

## Similarities
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee](http://gg.gg/19zkau). Note that Python require additional commands to run Earth Engine.
```

In fact, it's similar enough to make each coding language organized in your head, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.


```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of <-, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option and - (Alt and minus sign) in Windows/Mac.
```
## R mapping

## LidR
Example coming soon!
