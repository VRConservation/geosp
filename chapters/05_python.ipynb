    "Python is widely applicable and used in the geospatial community. ArcGIS Pro has a Python package called Arcpy, and QGIS has a package named PYQGIS. However, even though Arcpy is a Python package, it is not easy or intuitive to use. I tried it, read an entire book on it, and struggled using the notebooks, which are slow to load and not easy to link to VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I found Geemap and Leafmapâ€”incredible, user-friendly Python packages developed by Qiusheng Wu and available on GitHub at GISWQS. There are also clear tutorials at leafmap.org and geemap.org and videos at [Open Geospatial Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@giswqs). Many analyses require only one line of code. Here, geospatial analysis using scripts just clicked for me, and it opened up another world to using Python to analyze data rapidly.\n",
