# R

## Code Comparison
Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).

```{list-table} Javascript, Python, R code comparison. Adapted from [rgee's read me page](http://gg.gg/19zkau).
:header-rows: 1
:name: comparison

* - Javascript
  - Python
  - R
* - //Import dataset
  - #Import EE, dataset
  - #Import rgee, dataset
* - n/a
  - import ee
  - library(rgee)
* - n/a
  - ee.Initialize()
  - ee_Initialize()      
* - var db = 'CGIAR/SRTM90_V4'
  - db = 'CGIAR/SRTM90_V4'
  - db <- 'CGIAR/SRTM90_V4'   
* - var image = ee.Image(db)
  - image = ee.Image(db) 
  - image <- ee$Image(db)
* - print(image.bandNames())
  - image.bandNames().getInfo()
  - image$bandNames()$getInfo()
* - (output) #> ["elevation"]   
  - #> ['elevation']
  - #> [1] "elevation"
```
In fact, it's similar enough to make each challenging to keep straight, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese.


```{tip} R has the somewhat annoying symbol for variables or assignment operator of < + -, but you can quickly enter it using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option + - in Windows/Mac.
```
