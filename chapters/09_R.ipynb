An excellent free and open source book hosted on Github and covers many aspects of geospatial analysis in R {cite}`lovelace`. **[Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/)** is another excellent resource {cite}`sds`. Both publications are great if you are new to R. Spatial Data Science is particularly good for explanations and figures accompanied by R codeblocks to show you how to put together the code.\n",
