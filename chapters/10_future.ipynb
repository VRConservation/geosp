    "# Future\n",
    "\n",
    "Where your geospatial journey may lead you and the future of open-source geospatial software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming soon!\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "## Future\n",
    "There's a lot to learn in the geospatial world, and open source usually requires more knowledge and troubleshooting but ultimately greater control over your data, analysis, outcomes, and visualization. It's a high-risk/high-gain situation! This chapter provides some thoughts on where free and open-source software may go and, more importantly, where your learning may lead in the future. Future predictions are always wrong, except where you determine your future. So, take my futuristic suggestions lightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I'm going to take a crack at it with a few ideas given where the field seems to be headed and most of these are already happening. However, they may not be fully adopted in the mainstream. Luckily for me, executable books are easily updated, but here we go\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cloud native**. Geocomputation in the cloud is faster than your own machine and requires fewer storage resources. It's likely that all data, processing, and analysis goes to the cloud or something similar.\n",
    "2. **Geospatial files**. This is an exciting one. Yet despite being mundane, so necessary. File structure changed to geoparquet or other more portable, quick indexing files\n",
    "3. **Visualization**. Easier, more creative, and creating visualization with fewer lines of code will be possible. It's great how flexible R and Python are for creating map and graphic visualization but 10-20 lines of code (or more) for a scatterplot could be much simpler.\n",
    "4. **Lidar everywhere**. Plus higher resolution imagery all round- but at a cost\n",
    "5. **Open source hardware & software**. \n",
    "6. **Geo data atlas**. Comprehensive, standardized, and regularly updated datasets available in online libraries, importable to your analysis with a link, centrally located, and in decade long time-series.\n",
    "7. **Map something mobile**. The most commonly used maps are on your phone, used to drive, locate cafes, and locate your friends. Spatial based apps that billions use will continue to evolve. Open crowd sourcing of data already happens through iNaturalist and Seek, what more could be brought to bear in this realm and bring geospatial analysis to more people, e.g., beyond the niche crowd of geospatial data scientists?\n",
    "8. **Integration**. Better integration across platforms, languages, and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybrid workflows\n",
    "Use case of CMP analog conceptual model development with fine-scale veg map and planning, such as Marin Forest Health Strategy. Adapt/paste the storymap.\n",

    "## Online\n",
    "There are a number of emerging free and open source online mapping options, some code-based, others that allow you to upload datasets and yet others still that have an entire system for analysis and planning based within predefined visualization tools. Here are several that are worth checking out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [rapid editor](https://rapideditor.org/edit). Rapid editor integrates advanced mapping tools, authoritative geospatial open data, and cutting-edge technology to empower OpenStreetMap mappers at all levels.\n",
    "- [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/). Open-source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale datasets.\n",
    "- [py.cafe](https://py.cafe/). Run, edit, and share python apps in your browser.\n",
    "- [marxan](https://marxansolutions.org). Conservation analysis using Marxan's tried and tested approach to conservation planning. Strong community\n",

    "## GDAL/PDAL\n",
    "I didn't cover the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, or GDAL, in this version because I have only used it a couple of times, one of which completely broke my coding setup and required deleting and reinstalling a python environment, QGIS, and anaconda. Hopefully, I won't make the same again nor use the same scorched earth fix. Below are several resources to explore these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robert Simmon shared an excellent six-part series called [A Gentle Introduction to GDAL](https://medium.com/planet-stories/a-gentle-introduction-to-gdal-part-1-a3253eb96082). In Part 1, the author answers why GDAL and GIS systems are great for analyzing geospatial data. However, most GIS software is expensive, difficult to learn, and won't run on his OS. He says the good news is that GDAL is a free and open-source alternative, broadly supported, constantly updated and runs on almost any OS. But it is difficult to learn, especially if you're terrified of command lines.\n",
    "- Joshua Stevens has a convincing deck on using the command line for cartographic workflows [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jscarto/commanding-cartography-take-control-of-faster-more-elegant-workflows-from-the-command-line?slide=39).\n",
    "- Open Source Options has a [GDAL Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK-eCFUFgkQ) on youtube that shows how to use Python and GDAL to read, create, and display raster data.\n",
    "- [PDAL Tutorial](https://sites.google.com/thewatershedcenter.com/caflclanding/code-tutorials/pdal-tutorials?authuser=0) from the Watershed Research and Training Center. This helps you install the Point Data Abstraction Library, or PDAL, and run it from a container. It does not run you through a sample dataset.\n",
    "- [pdal.io](https://pdal.io/en/2.7-maintenance/) will help get you started with PADL.\n",
    "- Spatialised has a nice tutorial on [Lidar processing with PDAL, WMTS, and geobash](https://www.spatialised.net/lidar-and-geobash/) and also a video from FOSS4G Bucharest on [Exploiting PDAL and Entwine in the Wild](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-267-exploiting-pdal-entwine-in-the-wild#t=34).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go forth!\n",
    "The bottom line is to keep learning and practicing your geospatial skills. Try something out, share it, get feedback and learn! I'm curious to hear about your journeys. Please let me know what you think about the book, what could be added, and your journey in the github discussion connected to the repo where FOSS Geospatial tools is hosted. Thanks!\n",
