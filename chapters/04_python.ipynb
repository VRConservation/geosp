    "\n",
    "Python is widely applicable and used in the geospatial community. ArcGIS Pro has a python package called Arcpy and QGIS has a packaged named PYQGIS. However, Arcpy is not easy or intuitive to use, even though it's a python package. I tried it, I read an entire book on it, I struggled using the notebooks, which are slow to load and not easy to link to VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I found geemap and leafmap, incredible user friendly python packages developed by Qiushen Wu and available on github at GISWQS, along with clear tutorials at leafmap.org and geemap.org and videos at [Open Geospatial Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@giswqs). Many analyses require only one line of code. Here, geospatial analysis using scripts just clicked for me and it opened up another world to using Python to rapidly analyse data.\n",
