    "## Background\n",
    "QGIS is a fantastic alternative to ArcGIS Pro, especially since it's free, updated regularly, and has a supportive community surrounding it. It is a desktop package and has additional packages that come with it for download, such as GRASS GIS, which are worth checking out. QGIS is a challenging tutorial because there are so many resources available to learn how to use it. This chapter assumes you have downloaded QGIS and know how to use it. If you do not, see the Introduction to QGIS and Map Academy tutorials listed in the Resources section of this chapter. \n",

See the dropdown case on land use change in Kenya using QGIS analytical tools conducted by scientists at the Remote Sensing Research Group, Institute of Geomatics, GIS and Remote Sensing, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.

    "3. study established the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and the climatic elements in the Muringato basin. Understanding the LULC dynamics amid changing climatic conditions can catalyze the community to the need for sustainable resource utilization.\n",
    "4. Free and open-source geospatial tools were critical to this study because they provided a freely accessible platform supporting the manipulation of the data \n",
    "\n",
    "**INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study was undertaken in the Muringato basin, in the Upper Tana River Basin, Kenya. The basin covers an area of approximately 225 km2 (Fig. 1). The continued degradation of the forest land within the basin, has been greatly influenced by anthropogenic factors, key among them being deforestation, and conversion of wetlands into agricultural land (Muringato WRUA, 2014). This research therefore aimed at characterizing the changes in part of the Aberdare forest cover from 1990 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "**METHODS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Land Use Land Classification analysis was undertaken to establish the changes in climatic conditions within the Muringato basin. This was achieved through a time series analysis of Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 satellite Imagery acquired between 1990 and 2020 (Liu et al., 2009). The imagery was pre-processed, and a LULC classification was performed using the Support Vector Machine Classifier. This classifier was preferred since it works well with even and uneven structured data (Rudrapal et al., 2015). Please see the Muringato Appendix for a more detailed workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RESULTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Forest cover comprised 121 km2 of the Muringato catchment area in 1990 {numref}`lulc`. This decreased to 90 km2 in 2000, signifying a 25% reduction in forest cover. The forest cover 2010 was 85 km2, a 29% reduction compared to 1990. In 2020, the forest cover was 80 km2. This was a 33% reduction to 1990. The reduction in forest land was attributed to the conversion into range and built-up lands. The overall classification accuracies for the images ranged from 79.06% to 89.09%, and the kappa coefficient ranged from 72.32 -85.73. The analysis of climate elements revealed that the average climatic changes in the basin rose 1.36°C and 0.94°C in max and min temperature, respectively.\n",
