    "QGIS is a challenging tutorial to put together because there are so many resources available. This chapter assumes you have downloaded QGIS and have basic knowledge of how to use it. If you do not, see the Introduction to QGIS and Map Academy tutorials listed in the Resources section of this chapter.\n",

    "### Add data\n",
    "1. If you haven't already installed the QuickMapServices plugin, go to Plugins/Not installed, look for QuickMapServices and select Install Plugin. In QMS search for Dark Matter and click Add to add it as a basemap.\n",
    "2. Go to the [Biodiviersity Conservation](https://rrk.sdsc.edu/sierra.html#bio_conserv) dataset for the California Wildfire Task Force Regional Resource Kits. Under Species Diversity/Wildlife Species Richness click the pull down menu for Raw Data, download then unzip the tif file.\n",
    "3. Add your downloads folder to favorites in the browser panel by navigating to your downloads, right clicking, and selecting add to favorites. In the favorites at the top of the panel, open downloads, the species richness file, then draft the tif onto the map canvas. It should appear on the map and in your layers:\n",
