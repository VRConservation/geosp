    "In fact, it's similar enough to make each coding language organized in your head, almost like learning Spanish and Portuguese. It's probably better to focus on one or the other, but you may find that one language sometimes offers better packages, processes data more quickly than the other, or is preferred in a particular workplace."

    "The [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) desktop IDE is very good and only requires a two stop installation of R and RStudio. The IDE has a terminal, code section, installs packages through search, a variable/file panel, and a preview window that will show maps, graphs, or other outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/). \n",
    "2. Install the language server in R: 'install.packages(\"languageserver\")'\n",
    "3. Go to extensions and install the R Extension Pack by Yuki Ueda. This will install R (the coding language) and R-LSP (provides language support and autocomplete for commands).\n",
    "4. Install extra packages such as [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) to make R easier to use. See the notes in the R extension in VS Code for additional recommendations, links, and installation instructions. [This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-fresh-start-for-r-in-vscode-ec61ed108cf6) article is a concise guide for setup. \n",

    "**Running R Script**. You can run each line of code entered by placing the cursor at the comment or line of code you want to run then clicking the Run button in the upper right of the code pane (default location upper left) or using control/command enter on your keyboard. You can also highlight an entire block or section of code and run it with the same command.\n",
