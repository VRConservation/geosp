    "R is the definitive programming language for data analysis and visualization in academia. But it's increasingly being used more broadly due to its ease of use and many analysis packages.\n",

    "Javascript, Python, and R have strikingly similar code structure ({numref}`comparison`).\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, it's similar enough to make each coding language organized in your head, almost like learning and remembering Spanish and Portuguese."

    "## Installation\n",
    "The [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) desktop IDE is very good and only requires a two stop installation of R and RStudio. The IDE has a terminal, code section, installs packages through search, a variable/file panel, and a preview window that will show maps, graphs, or other outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to install yet another IDE, you can run R through VS Code with a number of basic to bespoke options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/). \n",
    "2. Install the language server in R: 'install.packages(\"languageserver\")'\n",
    "3. Go to extensions and install the R Extension Pack by Yuki Ueda. This will install R (the coding language) and R-LSP (provides language support and autocomplete for commands).\n",
    "4. Install extra packages such as [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) to make R easier to use. See the notes in the R extension in VS Code for additional recommendations, links, and installation instructions. [This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-fresh-start-for-r-in-vscode-ec61ed108cf6) article in Medium is a concise guide for setup. \n",

    "## EDA\n",
    "The R library DataExplorer allows you to quickly perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip} **Package Installation**. If you're using RSTudio you can also install packages by going to the packages tab in the Files, Plots, Packages pane (default location lower right), select Packages, Install then enter the package name in the open window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running R Script**. You can run each line of code entered by placing the cursor at the comment or line of code you want to run then clicking the Run button in the upper right of the code pane (default location upper left) or using control/command enter on your keyboard. You can also highlight an entire block or section of code and run it with the same command.\n",
