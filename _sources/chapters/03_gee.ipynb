    "**Your intro to geospatial analysis in the cloud**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "- See the [Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine](https://www.eefabook.org/go-to-the-book.html) book or the [GEE Course](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/google-earth-engine/) from Spatial Thoughts to get started.\n",
    "GEE's strength is cloud-based analysis, not visualization. For better visualization/cartographic tools, see Chapters 4, 5, and 8.\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "You need to do a quick exploratory data analysis of above and below-ground carbon biomass for an area of interest near Lake Tahoe in the Central Sierra, California. A donor has asked you to do this by the end of the week. You go down the hall to the right where the map plotters are, and ask the GIS guy. He peers up above his array of screens, says he's busyworking on a dozen other projects, he might be able to get you something in 2 weeks. He suggests you check out Google Earth Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! You've heard of this, and you think Google Earth will be easy. But when you check out Earth Engine and find a console with an empty map, the required Javascript coding is another universe, let alone language. \n",
    "\n",
    "## DIY\n",
    "This scenario is even if you have a GIS guy down the hall with the defunct plotter. Many of you are too small and can't afford to pay someone or a consultant to conduct your geospatial analysis. How do you DIY it? Free and open source software (FOSS), or FOSS4G when it refers to free and open source geospatial, is readily available, and, much better than a costly yearly subscription fee, it is free. Contrary to popular opinion, it's not that difficult to start. The full code for this example can be found [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/609ec9275c6c686b4ddd394f520a27a2).\n",

You can search for any set in the catalog, click on sample and get an instantaneous view of the data. In reality, this is almost akin to no-code. It also computes and adds any layer in the cloud, so it doesn't matter how old or slow your computer is, you can run the geospatial computations in the cloud. This is a tremendous advantage, especially for more complex analyses.\n",

    "- **Remote Sensing with GEE**. If you want to get serious about Google Earth Engine, I highly recommend you read the free online Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine [book](https://www.eefabook.org/) by Rebecca Moore et al. This book is worth reading as a remote sensing textbook and guides you through nearly everything from basic to complex using Earth Engine.\n",
    "- **Awesome-GEE**. An incredible curated list of GEE resources can be found in at the opengeos [Awesome-GEE](https://github.com/opengeos/Awesome-GEE) github repo. This incredible resource has everything from getting started to courses, papers, datasets, and much more. You could lose yourself for days in here!\n",
    "- **GEE Google Group**. For answers to many other questions the Google Earth Engine Developers [listserv](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers) is quite useful.\n",
    "- **Awesome-GEE-Community-Catalog**. Not to be confused with Awesome-GEE is the equally awesome 'treasure-trove' of datasets at [awesome-gee-community-catalog](https://gee-community-catalog.org/). "
